| Function Name  | Parameters | Return Type | Description |
| --- | --- |--- |--- |
| ABoard  | - | - | Constructor for class. Creates 64 grids as static meshes and attaches them to root component. |
| BeginPlay  | - | void | Defines default materials for grids, such as light or dark. |
| HighlightGrid  | UStaticMeshComponent* Grid | void | Changes grid's material to highlighted material.  |
### Properties
| Property Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BoxComponent | UBoxComponent* | Used as root component. |
| StaticMeshes | TArray<class  UStaticMeshComponent*> | Pointer array to hold every grid's address. |
| LightMaterial | UMaterial | Light colored grid material for the white chess grids. |
| DarkMaterial | UMaterial | Dark colored grid material for the black chess grids. |
| HighlightedMaterial | UMaterial | Grid's material is changed to this when player has ability to move to this grid. |
| SelectedMaterial | UMaterial | Grid's material is changed to this when player has selected to move to this grid. |
| DefaultMaterial | UMaterial | This is null by default. Only used as temporary pointer when grid's original material is changed to highlighted or selected material. |

## APARENTCLASS
This class is a parent class for all chess pieces.
### Functions
| Function Name  | Parameters | Return Type | Description |
| --- | --- |--- |--- |
| AParentClass | - | - | Constructor for class. Gets materials then assigns them to variables. |
| SetSelected | - | void | Call when actor is selected by mouse click. Changes actor's material to selected material to indicate it is selected.|
| SetDeselected | - | void | Called when actor is deselected. Changes actor's material to it's original material.|
| SetEliminateMaterial | - | void | Changes pieces material to eliminate material if this piece can be eliminated by making move. | 
| ChangeLocation | FVector MoveLocation | void | Called when actor is moved by the player. Gets one parameter which holds location to move. | 
| DetectSelectableGrids | SelectableGrids, DefaultMaterials | void | Detects selectable grids to move the piece. Gets 2 parameters. After function complete, first one holds selectable grid's addresses second one holds those grid's default materials sequentially. | 
| Eliminate | - | void | Eliminates piece from game. |
### Properties
| Property Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WhiteMaterial | UMaterial | White material for the piece. |
| BlackMaterial | UMaterial | Black material for the piece. |
| SelectedMaterial | UMaterial | Material to set when piece is selected. |
| EliminateMaterial | UMaterial | Material to set when piece could be eliminated. |

## Beacuse of the reasons I am to lazy I haven't written API for the all classes. However hopefully it will come back soon...
